Todo List

General TODOs

-- For CVPR --
1. Do not save 1 state per element in the batch. DONE
2. Make it work by only Rec loss in Boun_Balls
3. Train Koopman / Dynamics separately after convergence of the object segmentation. Different set of parameters.
4. Broadcast decoder, new implementation.
5.

-- OLD --
1. Increase complexity of U encoder (Not embedding)
2. Use modified spectralnorm from Sandesh to impose smoothness in mapping and inv_mapping.
3. In test mode we should impose always the same annealing mode for collisions.
4. Spectral Norm in all networks. --> Doesn't work well
5. Recover full state instead of last coordinate.
6. Pred-only confidence value.

7. Check if validation is a different loader!!!
