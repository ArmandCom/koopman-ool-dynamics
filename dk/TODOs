Todo List

General TODOs

1. Increase complexity of U encoder (Not embedding)
2. Use modified spectralnorm from Sandesh to impose smoothness in mapping and inv_mapping.
3. In test mode we should impose always the same annealing mode for collisions.
4. Spectral Norm in all networks. --> Doesn't work well
5. Recover full state instead of last coordinate.
6. Pred-only confidence value.

7. Check if validation is a different loader!!!
