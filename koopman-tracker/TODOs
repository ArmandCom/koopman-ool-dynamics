Todo List

General TODOs

1. implement VAE using pyro framework
2. implement basic version of koopman. Only system matrix, no interactions, with prediction capability in DSPRITES
3. implement multiobject with no interactions. Slot attention with 2 objects and no interactions for DSPRITES
4. implement koopman with interactions. A and B (with inputs and object interactions) matrices with different structures. Test in new dataset.

5. Define experiments for different tasks.
6. Define baselines for each experiment.
